# adventcalender


![Image logo](./adventcalender.jpg)

We are building an advent calender in multiple steps. Each day in December, a new popular quote is availalbe in our advent calender.

There is an main branch with some examples, which should not be changed anymore. There is a `release/2020` which should contain all our current changes. This branch will be used for test and for production.

Our default workflow is 
* create a feature branch from `release/2020`
* apply the changes as described in the user stories
* commit your changes with a comment in the following format "US-NN: 'and some comment'", where USNN is your current user story.
* push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub
* create a pull request (PR)
* find a collegue to approve your PR
* merge the PR into `release/2020` and delete the feature branch

** Follow the instructions of your trainer and have some fun.**
