Your first task is to create a seperate files with a qoute for each day in December. There are some common acceptance certeria for this task:

* The pattern of the file name is: `[ordinal number of day]_day.txt` 
(ordinal numers are 1th, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ....)
* Each file has to consist 3 lines
1. the day number
1. the quote
1. the author

You will find your day, the quote and the author in the following table.

| US-002 | Trainer | 2 | Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. Martin Fowler  |
| US-003 | Trainer | 3 | Would you rather Test-First, or Debug-Later? Robert Cecil Martin  |
| US-004 | Trainer | 4 | Code never lies, comments sometimes do. Ron Jeffries  |
| US-005 | Trainer | 5 | The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple. Grady Booch  |
| US-006 | Trainer  | 6 | The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity. Edsger Dijkstra  |
| US-007 | Trainer | 7 | A fool with a tool is still a fool. Grady Booch  |
| US-008 | Trainer | 8 | It is not enough for code to work. Robert Cecil Martin |
| US-009 | Trainer | 9 | Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation. Bertrand Meyer |
| US-010 | Trainer | 10 | If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. Edsger Dijkstra  |
| US-011 | Trainer | 11 | Make it work, make it right, make it fast. Kent Beck |

| US-014 | Trainer | 14 | Programming is a skill best acquired by practice and example rather than from books. Alan Turing  |
| US-015 | Trainer | 15 | The most fundamental problem in software development is complexity. There is only one basic way of dealing with complexity: divide and conquer. Bjarne Stroustrup  |

| US-024 | Trainer | 24 | Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated. Edsger Dijkstra  |
